## Suggestions for choosing a topic

New writers can choose some social events that can be observed in everyday life to start with, and by starting with a specific event, an analysis can be made as to which policy leads to this result, or which failed policy should be responsible for this.


Another simple topic to pick: a summary of the various opinions in the public sphere on controversial issues, and an analysis of the positions of differnt political forces.

## Hand in your writing plan


Your [country of interest](/interests); Your [topic](/tags) (you can change it later).
Your specific delivery date. your and anonym and your email.

###  Example:

Italy, digital populism, 31/08/2022, Bachelor, <a href="mailto:intlcommu@outlook.com">intlcommu@outlook.com</a>


## Writing Principles

### Principle of factuality


Correct disclosure of facts is a fundamental principle of journalism. We should always strive to be accurate, provide all relevant facts in our possession, and ensure that those facts are verified. When we cannot substantiate the information, we should explain accordingly. Take the following sentences as an example:

Some corrupt officials are arrested by the police.

 “Corrupt officials” should be rephrased as “officials suspected of corruption” without a court ruling. If we further verify the information, and find that the court didn’t issue a formal arrest warrant, then the word ‘arrested” may not be accurate due to a missing of court warrant, therefore it’s better to be rephrased as “detained for further investigation”. 

Some officials suspected of corruption are detained by the police for further investigation.


### Principle of objectivity


We recommend using objectified sentences to describe news and intelligence. This is for two reasons: firstly, objective writing itself keeps our own minds clear, minimizes the tendency to be over-optimistic or over-pessimistic and forces us to be as rational as possible, and secondly, objectivity attracts a neutral readership, so that many people do not simply ignore our analysis out of prejudice against communist ideology. Moreover, objectifying statements does not actually prevent the implicit expression of our subjective tendencies. It is possible to lead a neutral readership to accept our pre-determined position through an apparently objective analysis.


example for the principle of objectivity

objective description
In mainland China, the 'non-household-registrated population', as new immigrants to the city, are often among the lowest paid urban residents, often working in the lowest income bracket or in rather precarious employment. Universal basic income will be important for these people to maintain their livelihoods. But if these people were to be excluded by the household registration system, it would be quite controversial.

non-objective description
…… The household registration system must be eliminated first, otherwise a universal basic income system cannot benefit all people.


## Citations requirement
