For the third time, within 6 years, the current British prime minister has once again resigned. Boris Johnson, the prime minister since the summer of 2019, has resigned due to a series of political scandals, including accusations of attending a party, and association with Chris pincher, who has been accused of sexual assault. Since Johnson, announced he would be resigning, a leadership election occurred, with the finalists being Rishi Sunak and Elizabeth Truss. 

Sunak, who was a major factor in the resignation of Johnson as he left his position in the UK cabinet causing pressure on Johnson to resign, has become a rival of Johnson's political allies, namely Truss. While Truss, has been considered a faviroute to win, having favor with the higher-ups of the Conservative party, the results won't be revealed until the re-opening of parliament on the 5th of September, where a vote between the two will happen for the Tory members. This has caused dismay among members of the public, as a change of power seems to be an annual occurrence in British politics. 

However, all of this could change in 2024, with the election leading to a change of the power dynamic, meaning a new situation could occur, in the political landscape, with Keith starmer, the head of the opposition, running as the labor candidate, however, he has been criticized for supposed inaction against the Conservative Party. What this goes to show, is the political landscape within the UK, is a complex, and ever-changing one.
