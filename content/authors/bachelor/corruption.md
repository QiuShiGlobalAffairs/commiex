CCP's penalties for intra-party corruption are getting softer. 

Since 2010s, Chinese Communist Party's Disciplinary Committee has made a great innovation - to reduce application of the criminalization of corrupt burocracts, and replace it with party discipline punishment, to emphasize the transformation and the reuse of bureaucracts. The maximum amnesties for bureaucrats’ corruption can involve up to 30,000 yuan which is around 5000 euros. That's to say, corruption under 5,000 euros in China only exposes corrupt officials to party discipline such as suspension of promotions or  office, which is in sharp contrast to the Mao era's zero tolerance for corruption within the party.

中共对党内腐败的处罚正在变轻

2010年以来，中国共产党纪律委员会作出了一重大创新——减少对腐败官僚的刑事定罪，代之以党纪处分，强调对官僚的改造和重新使用。对党内官僚腐败的刑事豁免最高可达3万元，约合5000欧元。 也就是说，在中国5000欧元以下的腐败，只会让贪官受到停职、暂停提拔等党纪处分。这与毛泽东时代对党内腐败的零容忍形成鲜明对比。
