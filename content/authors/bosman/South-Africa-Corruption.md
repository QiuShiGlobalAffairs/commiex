Former president Jacob Zuma collaborated with a wealthy family called Gupta to put their own loyalists into political positions. To the extent that the damage and collusion is still being investigated to this day.

### NOTIBLE INCIDENTS
•	The backroom deals that led to the purchasing of trains from the South Chinese Rail Company （中国南车） amounting to 6 billion USD.
•	Handing of state owned mines to members of Gupta family at dirt cheap prices
•	Help to expand Gupta family's influence in a state owned company——Eskom, which is South Afica's mainly electricity producer. 

### WHAT IS BEING DONE 
•    Former president Jacob zuma stepped down as president of south Africa and vice president Cyril ramaposa has replaced him as president
•    The zondo commission has closed its probe into the state capture and released its report to the public
•    Rajesh and atule Gupta have been arrested for allegations including corruption and money laundering
•    Ajay Gupta has avoided arrest by cooperating with officials against his brothers atul Gupta and rejesh Gupta.
(In 2016 Atul Gupta became the seventh-wealthiest person in South Africa, with an estimated net worth of R10.7 billion (US$773.47 million), based on JSE-listed holdings.)

### ANALYSIS 
Some outraged South African people are demanding the fair trial and the appropriate sentences for these corrupt officials.
The South African communist party claims that they are fighting for workers’ rights and against corruption all together.
They believe that the fight against corruption must be realized through the mass education and the mobilization of the proletariat
