SNU: the New Nationalist Conscript   

What is the SNU ? :

The SNU is a new French national conscription program which will be fully implemented from 2026. The first version of SNU was introduced in 2018. The SNU requires all young French people between the ages of 16 and 25 to attend a month-long training course. If they do not attend, they will not be able to obtain a high school diploma or a driving licence. In 2018, 45 000 teenagers participated in SNU, in 2022 the plan covers 400 000 teenagers. 

SNU ?

The goal of the SNU is "to improve national cohesion". Half of the month-long training is devoted to civic education and theoretical learning. During the training period, the daily schedule follows a strict timetable and there is a roll call and group singing of the national anthem every morning. 

SNU has some educational programs, including environmental programs which provide publicity about the Macron government‘s plan to revitalize the economy through the ecological transition, and Military Programs which provide education on French Army and French military action around the world.

 Teenagers trained in the SNU are supervised by military/state officials to ensure that there is no activity against the french government inside and that the “Republic value“ is respected by everyone. 

Conclusion :

SNU promotes good spirit of sportism and group cohesion… But for many left wing, the SNU influences youth with nationalism and policy preference of Macron gouvernement.
